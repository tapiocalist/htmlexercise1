      You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your
      13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking
      Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your
      40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally
      has box-shadow.<strong>Wrong, motherfucker</strong>.
